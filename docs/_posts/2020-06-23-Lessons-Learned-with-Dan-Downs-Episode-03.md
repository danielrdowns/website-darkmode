<b>Episode summary:</b>

- DD does a review of Swift Playgrounds, Apple's eductaion-focused development environment for learning the Swift Language. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

<b>Feedback from Episode #02:</b>

- It was suggested to me to start with a full-face opener going forward. 


<b>Observations:</b>

- Using 2 separate Looms to make this was A+. Will continue to do so in the future.
- Picture-in-picture was not used for the deep dive into Swift. Will likely integrate in the future; this episode had technical issues which prevented use.
- Need to make a thicker red circle for the Youtube thumbnail.
- Technically, this is a "Swift Playgrounds Review" versus a "Swift Review" as described in the thumbnail. Getting "Swift Playgrounds Review" to fit in an elegant manner was tough. Clocking in at just over 14 minutes - I do indeed consider this review to be speedy. It certainly is swift. ;)
