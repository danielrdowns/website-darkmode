A friend recently asked why I chose now to establish a personal website for cataloging my thoughts and productions.

It would be tough to assert that now is a not challenging time to launch a new project.

I believe that building now is more important than ever.

Regardless of whether you are launching a business, developing a novel product, crafting an innovative art project, or inaugurating some other endeavor, it is essential that we build.

At this time, humanity as a species is again reminded that our supposed omnipotent dominion of Earth was merely a <i>façade</i>.

We are reminded of our mortality, our fragility, and our station in an unforgiving Universe.

This is not a bad thing. Seeing the world as it is allows one to take appropriate action.

<i>Homo sapiens</i> did not outcompete other human species & spread to all corners of our globe by fleeing adversity, but through identifying challenges on the road ahead and dealing with them appropriately.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

At this time we should take stock, figure out where we want to go from here, decide a course of action, and execute.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>

For us as individuals and organizations - as families and communities - the choice is ours for what we want to see in a post-crisis world.

Now is the time to roll up our shirtsleeves and get to work.
